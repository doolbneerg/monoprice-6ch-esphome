# Monoprice 6ch Audio Receiver - ESP Home Interface
This is an ESP32 to RS232 adapter for the Monoprice 6ch Whole Home Audio Amplifier.

It has support for direct control via ESPHome (via web-server ui, or via HomeAssistant API/Mqtt).

This is a hard fork of jhenkens' code to better fit my use cases.
